```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"></html>
```

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.
- **`<html lang="en">`**: The opening `<html>` tag indicates the beginning of the HTML document. The `lang="en"` attribute specifies that the language of the document is English.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
  <title>Gallery</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  <script src="./app.js" defer></script>
</head>
```

- **`<head>`**: The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document, such as its title, character set, linked CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **`<meta charset="UTF-8" />`**: This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document, which is UTF-8. UTF-8 is a widely used encoding that supports many languages and symbols.
- **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`**: This tag provides instructions to the browser on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. The `width=device-width` part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device), and `initial-scale=1.0` ensures that the page loads at the default zoom level.
- **`<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />`**: This tag is used to specify the document mode in Internet Explorer. The `content="ie=edge"` value tells IE to use the latest rendering engine available, ensuring that the page renders correctly.
- **`<title>Gallery</title>`**: This sets the title of the document, which will appear in the browser's title bar or tab.
- **`<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />`**: This link tag includes an external CSS file (`styles.css`) that contains styles for the HTML document. The `rel="stylesheet"` attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked file.
- **`<script src="./app.js" defer></script>`**: This script tag links to an external JavaScript file (`app.js`). The `defer` attribute ensures that the script is executed after the HTML document has been fully parsed, preventing any potential blocking of page rendering.

```html
<body>
  <div class="gallery-container"></div>
</body>
```

- **`<body>`**: The opening `<body>` tag indicates the beginning of the content that will be displayed on the web page. Everything inside the `<body>` tag is what the user will see in their browser.
- **`<div class="gallery-container">`**: This is a `<div>` element (a block-level container) with a class name `gallery-container`. This div serves as the main container for the gallery content, and the class name can be used to apply specific styles via CSS.

```html
<div class="image-gallery">
  <img src="./images/1.jpg" alt="Image 1" class="gallery-img active" />
  <img src="./images/2.jpg" alt="Image 2" class="gallery-img" />
  <img src="./images/3.jpg" alt="Image 3" class="gallery-img" />
  <img src="./images/4.jpg" alt="Image 4" class="gallery-img" />
  <img src="./images/5.jpg" alt="Image 5" class="gallery-img" />
  <img src="./images/6.jpg" alt="Image 6" class="gallery-img" />
</div>
```

- **`<div class="image-gallery">`**: This is another `<div>` element with a class name `image-gallery`. It serves as a container specifically for the gallery images. The `gallery-container` div contains this `image-gallery` div.
- **`<img src="./images/1.jpg" alt="Image 1" class="gallery-img active" />`**: This line represents an image element (`<img>`). The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image file (`./images/1.jpg`). The `alt` attribute provides alternative text ("Image 1") that describes the image for accessibility purposes. The `class="gallery-img active"` assigns the image to the `gallery-img` class for styling and also marks it as `active`, which might mean it is the initially visible image in the gallery.
- The subsequent `<img>` tags follow the same pattern as the first one but point to different image files (2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc.) and have different alt text.

```html
<div class="gallery-controls">
  <button class="btn prev" disabled>Prev</button>
  <button class="btn next">Next</button>
</div>
```

- **`<div class="gallery-controls">`**: This `<div>` element is a container for the gallery control buttons (previous and next).
- **`<button class="btn prev" disabled>Prev</button>`**: This is a button element (`<button>`). The `class="btn prev"` assigns this button to the `btn` class and `prev` class for styling and possibly functionality. The `disabled` attribute indicates that the button is disabled (not clickable) when the page first loads. The button's label is "Prev".
- **`<button class="btn next">Next</button>`**: This is another button element for navigating to the next image. It has the classes `btn` and `next` but is not disabled initially. The button's label is "Next".

```html
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

- **`</div>`**: This closes the `gallery-controls` div.
- **`</div>`**: This closes the `gallery-container` div.
- **`</body>`**: This closes the `body` tag, indicating the end of the document's visible content.
- **`</html>`**: This closes the `html` tag, marking the end of the HTML document.

### Summary:

This HTML code sets up a basic gallery page with images that can be navigated using "Prev" and "Next" buttons. The structure is clean, and external CSS and JavaScript files are linked to handle the gallery's styling and functionality, respectively. The use of classes allows for easy targeting and manipulation of elements with CSS and JavaScript.
